# Coding-1-Final
 These are the starter files for F2020 Coding 1
 On my website when you first enter you are brough to the home page. At the top there is a nave bar that has three choices either Home, Contact, or About.
 Below the nav bar there is a carousel with two arrows which allow you to go through the pictures in the carousel. The images in the carousel are some pictures of me when I was younger. Below the carousel there is a footer which has the link to the website. When you navigate back up to the top of the website and click on contact in the nav bar it takes you to a new page where it has the same layout but instead of having a carousel it has my contact information. Again if you navigate back to the top there is an about page if you click on that it takes you to a new page all about me it has the same layout as the last two but it has a paragraph about me and a picture of a video game controller representing one of the things i do alot. Thats all to this website.
